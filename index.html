                    <p>Hi my name is Leo. I love to play soccer, go on hikes and build websites. I have a degree in
                        Public
                        Health and enjoy helping people become the best individual that they can be. I enjoy creating
                        websites for other health professionals. I also have a degree in Architecture, and have a
                        passion
                        for design.
                        I enjoy learning how things are put together, and it shows in all of my projects. Please look
                        around
                        my website to discover some projects I have been working on. I enjoy coding in HTML, CSS and
                        Javascript. I have a strong set of front end skills, but I am looking to master the backend as
                        well.
                        My goal for
                        2020 is to become a full stack web developer.</p>
