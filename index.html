            <p>Hi my name is Leo. I love to play soccer, go on hikes and build websites. I have a degree in Public Health and enjoy helping people become the best individual that they can be. I enjoy creating websites for other health professionals. I also have a degree in Architecture, and have a passion for design. I enjoy learning how things are put together, and it shows in all of my projects. Please look around my website to discover some projects I have been working on. I enjoy coding in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have a strong set of front end skills, but I am looking to master the backend as well. My goal for 2020 is to become a full stack web developer.</p>
